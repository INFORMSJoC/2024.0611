## Source Codes
The software/algorithm is originally coded in C# as shown in directory [src](src/), where two independent programs are uploaded for the two MCLP settings:
- $I=J$: selecting $p$ facilities from all demand nodes ($I$), where $J$ is the range of all possible facilities
- $I \neq J$, the range of possible facilities $J$ is not equal to the demand nodes $I$
  
For more details, as well as the new MCLP model and Cross-entropy method, refer to the original paper [Cross-entropy Method for the Maximal Covering Location Problem](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2024.0611).
