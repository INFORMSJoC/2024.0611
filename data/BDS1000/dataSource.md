## Data Source
The BDS100 benchmark data are proposed in the paper [Cross-entropy Method for the Maximal Covering Location Problem](https://doi.org/10.1287/ijoc.2024.0611) based on the original BDS data [BDS](data/BDS) from Fabio Furini, Ivana Ljubic and Jean-Francois Cordeau in this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/fabiofurini/LocationCovering).
For BDS100, we expanded the number of possible facility nodes from 100 to 1000.
